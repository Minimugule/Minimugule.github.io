            <h3>Construction of Anakin Skywalker</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong>: The goal of this <strong>Python</strong> is to study Anakin’s psychological and emotional evolution through his dialogues in the scripts of these three episodes. Using tools such as sentiment analysis and the extraction of recurring themes, we will analyze how linguistic choices reflect his transformation. This work aims to demonstrate the role of dialogue in the narrative construction of Anakin’s descent.</p>

            <p><strong>Summary</strong>: This <strong>Python</strong> project focused on analyzing road accident data in Rennes between 2012 and 2022. We examined the evolution of incidents involving injuries, fatalities, etc., as well as their geographical distribution using a map of accident locations. Additionally, we studied the distribution of accidents based on the types of vehicles involved, as well as the hours and days when accidents are most frequent. These analyses provide information to inform road safety policies and accident prevention efforts in the Rennes region.</p>

            <h3>Athletics in Brittany</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary</strong>: This <strong>Rshiny</strong> project focuses on studying athletics clubs in Brittany. Each year in athletics, inter-club competitions are held, covering all disciplines of this sport, such as running, throwing, jumping, walking, etc. The objective is to rank clubs at the national level. For each category, two men and two women participate, and points are awarded to the club based on their performances. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible. However, clubs do not have computer tools to calculate these points, forcing them to consult tables to determine the points awarded for their performances. We were asked to develop an application capable of performing this calculation and thus assigning the corresponding points to each event.</p>

            <h2>Decryption Project</h2>
            <p>This project was carried out in <strong>R</strong> during my second degree. The history of decryption dates back to antiquity with rudimentary methods of letter substitution. However, the real boom occurred during World War II, with major advances such as the decryption of Enigma by the Allies. Computer science then revolutionized the field with the advent of quantum computing and powerful encryption algorithms. Today, decryption is crucial for cybersecurity, data protection, and the fight against cybercrime, constantly motivating the development of new cryptographic techniques.</p>

Time series analysis is crucial for understanding and forecasting meteorological phenomena. In this report, we study the average temperatures recorded in London using various statistical and modeling tools. We apply time series decomposition techniques to identify trends and seasonal components, followed by ARIMA modeling to capture temporal dependencies. Our goal is to understand the trends and fluctuations of average temperatures in London.</p>

            <p><strong>Summary</strong>: This <strong>R</strong> project aims to predict NBA players' salaries. The intersection between NBA players' performance and their remuneration has always been a captivating subject. Our project delves into this dynamic, examining data from 1996 to 2017 to understand how individual performances influence players' contracts and salaries. Through an Econometric approach, we explore the links between on-court performances and players' financial compensation. In this context, we ask the following question: <strong>To what extent do individual basketball players' performances influence their salary?</strong></p>
            <p>This analysis is part of the broader context of current debates on professional athletes' salaries, offering significant insights for basketball enthusiasts, economic analysts, and actors in the sports world.</p>
